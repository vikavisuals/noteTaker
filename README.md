## Description
A simple note taking application, allowing for new notes to be written, viewed again, and deleted.

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- Heroku
- Node JS
- Express

## Challenges
- Understanding just how simple the code needed to be, I initially began with way too much work.
- Figuring out what works in Express was difficult, but I finally understood what works and why it does.
- Linking Heroku up with my app took a bit of work.
- Realizing how important file structure is, and how to properly read errors that popped up.
